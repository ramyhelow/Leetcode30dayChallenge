# LeetCode 30-Day Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the LeetCode 30-day challenge. Each day's solution is organized in its own directory with the problem description and implementation.

## Project Structure

```
Leetcode30dayChallenge/
├── Day1/              # Day 1 solution
├── Day2/              # Day 2 solution
└── ...                # Additional days
```

## Getting Started

1. Each day's solution is contained in its own directory
2. Solutions are implemented in Java
3. Each solution includes:
   - Problem description
   - Solution code
   - Test cases
   - Time and space complexity analysis

## Requirements

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)

## How to Run

To compile and run a solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the day's directory. For example, for Day 1:
   ```sh
   cd Day1
   ```
2. Compile the Java file (replace `Q1_SingleNumber.java` with the actual file name):
   ```sh
   javac Q1_SingleNumber.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class (replace `Q1_SingleNumber` with the class name):
   ```sh
   java Q1_SingleNumber
   ```
